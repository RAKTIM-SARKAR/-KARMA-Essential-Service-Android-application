# Objective


On a daily basis, we have a lot of household work/chores that we are unable to perform
them due to various reasons.
Some of the reasons are: -
• Busy work life
• Lack of skills required
• Physical disability
• Save time for other works
There are also a lot of workers and specialized skilled people who are unemployed due to a
lack of vacancies in various companies and industries. To overcome this problem, we want
to provide a platform where various workers/skilled people will register asservice providers,
allowing them to get more customers than the conventionalmethod. And on the other hand,
the service being provided to the customers will also make their life easier and solve the
problems mentioned earlier.
Some of the main objectives are given below:
• To enable customers to get quick and efficient services at home.
• According to the feedback, the profiles of the service provider will be listed.


No need to visit or make a call to the hospital for appointment.
• Online booking of appointment with doctors.
• Shows the list of doctors with their specialties.
• Shows the availability of the doctors for appointment.
